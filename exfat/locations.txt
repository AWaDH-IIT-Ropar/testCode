/usr/local/bin/usb-mount.sh
/etc/systemd/system/usb-mount@.service
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-local.rules

This seems to do the trick! A couple of useful commands for debugging stuff like this:

udevadm control -l debug turns on verbose logging to /var/log/syslog so you can see what's happening.
udevadm control --reload-rules after you modify files in the rules.d dir (may not be necessary, but can't hurt...).
systemctl daemon-reload after you modify systemd unit files

cp ./usb-mount.sh /usr/local/bin/

# Systemd unit file for USB automount/unmount 
cp ./usb-mount@.service /etc/systemd/system/usb-mount@.service

# Create udev rule to start/stop usb-mount@.service on hotplug/unplug
cat ./99-local.rules.usb-mount >> /etc/udev/rules.d/99-local.rules

systemctl daemon-reload
udevadm control --reload-rules
